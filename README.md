# Lottery

This is a very simple code that I created for my father since he loves to play lol.

This lotto simulator will generate 3 & 4 random numbers between 0-9

The first method will generate 3 random numbers
The second method will generate 4 random numbers

I might add more functionaility in the future, such as a user inputting 3/ or 4 random numbers.
Then compare the user input with the lotto generator, if the user wins - a message will print such as "You're a winner!"
